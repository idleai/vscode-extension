# EditChain History for VS Code

This extension opens one read-only history panel that stays up to date
automatically, combining Codex activity, imported Claude history, and Git.
The UI is a Rust/WASM renderer;
the TypeScript host starts the native service and handles VS Code integrations
such as JSON documents and native diff editors.

This compatibility extension lives beside the new Idle package in the
vscode-extension repository. Its settings, commands, archives and pending capture
outboxes retain their existing formats. See the
[assembly handoff](ASSEMBLY-MIGRATION.md) for the remaining installed-host migration.

## Build

Prerequisites:

- the repository Rust toolchain and `wasm32-unknown-unknown` target;
- `wasm-bindgen-cli` 0.2.127;
- Python 3.11 or newer;
- Node.js 22.12 or newer;
- sibling `editchain`, `app-core`, `web-ui` and `codex` checkouts.

From the repository root:

```sh
cargo build --release -p editchain-node --bins --locked
npm --prefix ../codex/tools/history-runtime ci

cd extensions/vscode-editchain
npm ci
npm run build:native
npm run build:renderer
npm run compile
```

`build:renderer` builds web-ui's `crates/editchain-history-renderer` for wasm32 and writes
the generated bundle under `media/rust-history/pkg/`. It also runs
`build:client-state`, which builds app-core's `editchain-client-state`
Node/WASM adapter under `media/client-state/pkg/`. The peer adapter no longer
bundles the renderer, DOM bindings or graph assets. Both committed asset trees
remain subject to reproducibility checks. See [the assembly handoff](ASSEMBLY-MIGRATION.md).

The asset scripts snapshot local crates into a generated Cargo workspace under
`target/wasm-workspace` in each owning repository. This keeps compiler identities independent of sibling
checkout paths, which Cargo otherwise includes for external path dependencies.
The snapshot retains package lint settings and verifies that every locked package
version and checksum is unchanged before building. External packages retain the
same enabled dependency graph as the source build; their own test and optional
tool dependencies are checked in their source repositories.

Follow the [packaging instructions](#packaging) to install the extension, open
the project you want to explore, and invoke **EditChain: Open History Explorer**.
The settings are:

- `editchain-history.servicePath`: absolute path to the native service binary.
  Release and then debug builds under the open workspace are preferred when
  empty, followed by the service bundled for the package's platform.
- `editchain-history.chainDir`: EditChain data directory relative to the open
  workspace, defaulting to `.editchain`.

## Multiplayer history

Each participant opens a separate workspace and keeps a durable local history.
Sharing exchanges immutable records and their referenced content. Your working
files stay under your control; a received history row opens its recorded diff.

1. On the joining device, run **EditChain: Create Multiplayer Join Request**.
   Give the copied public request to the host through your trusted channel.
2. On the host, run **EditChain: Host Shared History / Invite Device**. Paste the
   request, choose new records or explicit backfill, and approve the device
   fingerprint. Sign in to GitHub when prompted.
3. Give the copied private invitation to that device. It contains a connect-only
   grant and expires within one hour. Keep it out of issue trackers and logs.
4. On the joining device, run **EditChain: Join Shared History**, paste the
   invitation, choose its outgoing history scope, and approve the host identity.
5. Open **EditChain: Open History Explorer** on both sides. The Sharing status
   item distinguishes authentication, catch-up, live data and missing content.

The joining device uses the invitation grant; it does not receive the host's
GitHub credential. Persistent device keys stay in VS Code's private application
storage. For two replicas on one machine, use separate VS Code user-data
profiles so they receive distinct device identities.

**EditChain: Remove Shared Device** removes this replica's approval and closes
that connection. **EditChain: Stop Sharing History** disconnects peers and
deletes this window's hosted tunnel. Existing records and received copies stay
on their respective devices. **EditChain: Clean Up Multiplayer Tunnels** retries
cleanup of inactive resources for the current workspace and account.

Dropped connections retry automatically and catch up from durable history.
Reloading an enabled workspace resumes its approved connections. Invitations are
kept in VS Code SecretStorage; reconnect can use an already approved grant until
the service expires it. **EditChain: Resume / Reconnect Shared History** retries
after a network or account change. An expired grant needs a new invitation.
Host reloads retain the same private tunnel resource and device identity, with
a fresh endpoint. Closing VS Code leaves that resource available for resume
until its service expiry (up to one day); **Stop Sharing History** deletes it
and disables automatic resume.

A hard process exit can leave the other peer waiting for its 90-second liveness
deadline before reconnecting. The packaged restart test observed this delay;
normal socket disconnects retry sooner. An exited extension host releases its
local ownership lease immediately; cleanup preserves another live window's
lease and requires this window to stop sharing first.

**EditChain: Configure Multiplayer Repository Discovery** optionally publishes
public device certificates, relay endpoints, versions and ten-minute expiry in
GitHub repository variables. It asks for a repository and GitHub `repo` access;
you need collaborator access to that repository. Discovery polls once a minute,
ignores expired or incompatible entries, and refreshes only an approved device's
existing tunnel grant. Each new pair still exchanges and approves an invitation.
No account tokens or invitation grants are published. Directory failure does not
stop synchronization. Disable discovery through the same command to withdraw
this window's advertisement. If cleanup fails, the stale variable remains but
its endpoint is ignored after expiry.

`npm run build:native` builds and stages both native binaries for this platform.
For a custom development build, `editchain-history.peerPath` can select a worker
explicitly; otherwise it is found beside the service or in the package.

The automated live relay check uses three native processes, synthetic workspaces,
and the production Host/Join manager. It needs an authenticated GitHub CLI and
creates and deletes temporary private tunnels. It covers restart catch-up,
third-party forwarding with the original source offline, and live revocation:

```sh
cargo build -p editchain-node --bin editchain-vscode-service --locked
cargo build --manifest-path ../editchain/Cargo.toml -p editchain-sync --bin editchain-peer --locked
cd extensions/vscode-editchain
npm run compile
npm run test:multiplayer:relay
```

This check identifies itself as a same-machine test. A second network remains
a separate observation.

For the packaged two-window UI test, build and package from this directory:

```sh
npm run build:native
npm run build:renderer
npm run compile
mkdir -p ../../outputs
npx vsce package --out ../../outputs/editchain-history-multiplayer.vsix
npm run ui:vscode:multiplayer
```

The Linux harness needs Xvfb, unzip, Python 3 and a signed-in GitHub CLI. It
installs that VSIX into two temporary profiles, drives Host/Join approval and
actual typing, verifies remote History rows and exact native diffs, restarts the
host, and deletes its temporary tunnels. A test-only authentication provider
uses the CLI credential inside those isolated profiles. The provider and
automation bridge are excluded from the VSIX. This tests one account/machine;
it does not replace the different-account/network check or the built-in GitHub
sign-in spike. Screenshots and results are under `trace/multiplayer/`. The runner
checks its logs for credential material and removes its private fixture files.
Set `EDITCHAIN_MULTIPLAYER_UI_VSIX` or `EDITCHAIN_MULTIPLAYER_UI_VERSION` to test
another package or VS Code release; the default release is 1.132.0.

## Human work on AI-generated code

Human-work tracking starts automatically in trusted local workspace folders,
independently of the History panel. It records buffer snapshots, exact edits,
saves, renames, text-tab lifecycle, active editors, and qualified reading
indicators. Exposure timing, selections, and viewport changes stay local.
Unsaved edits are included. Each workspace folder
writes to its own configured chain. Untitled buffers belong to the first folder.

History shows human work as a connected series alongside agent work, anchored
to independently recorded Git context. Live episodes have the same disclosure
controls as agent tasks. Each human edit shows its file directly on one graph
row; click it to open the exact recorded before/after buffer diff, including
unsaved changes. Static History keeps human fragments as connected graph rows.
Raw capture details stay in Trace.

Version 0.1.7 publishes the first confirmed input immediately and updates the
same live edit row at **100 ms** intervals while typing. Its diff runs from the
first before-buffer to the latest after-buffer. Save finishes the edit; so do
editor/focus/context/lifecycle boundaries, an automatic or unconfirmed mutation
of that file, or a new input after **30 seconds** idle. Reads and changes to
background files do not finish the active edit. Undo and redo remain separate.
Each raw change and its input receipt are retained; coverage still measures
individual changed AI-origin lines. Saving an already recorded edit adds no
duplicate edit row. Older per-keystroke recordings remain unchanged.

Git context is sampled every 15 seconds and recorded when it changes. Its saved
workspace location and HEAD are used during replay; today's HEAD cannot rewrite
old work. These are shared working-tree activity branches, not isolated
snapshots. External changes can occur between observations.

Open **EditChain: Show Human Work Coverage** from the Command Palette. The
tracking status item opens **EditChain: Show Tracking Status**, a lightweight
runtime diagnostic in the output channel. The coverage report compares imported
AI file evidence with current saved files and shows nonblank AI-origin lines with reading indicators, human
edits, and their overlap. Historical counts retain work on lines
that were later changed or deleted, including unsaved human edits. Populate AI
evidence using the existing import or Live History workflow; missing provenance
is reported as unknown, never as zero human review of the whole codebase.

- **EditChain: Pause Human Work Tracking** and **Resume Human Work Tracking**
  control recording without changing the History panel.
- `editchain-history.tracking.enabled` defaults to `true`.
- `editchain-history.tracking.readDwellMs` defaults to `2000`. Reading requires
  one continuous qualifying interval at the same buffer revision and viewport.
  Each view emits one read at that threshold; shorter visits are discarded.
  The last view of each loaded document stays read through focus changes,
  switching tabs, and Git context updates. Scrolling or a new buffer revision
  rearms reading; elapsed time and repeated notifications alone do not.
- `editchain-history.tracking.maxFileBytes` defaults to `8388608` (8 MiB), also
  the supported maximum. This measures the entire unsaved buffer in UTF-8 bytes.
  NUL-containing and oversized buffers produce separate capture-gap reasons.
- `editchain-history.tracking.jsonl.enabled` defaults to `false`. When enabled,
  the recorder also writes its events to local JSONL archives that can be
  re-imported after a chain is rebuilt. Requires a trusted workspace and
  `editchain-history.tracking.enabled`.
- `editchain-history.tracking.jsonl.directory` defaults to `""`, which uses
  `human-history` under the extension's global storage directory. Absolute paths
  and `~` / `~/` paths are supported; a relative path resolves against the single
  workspace folder and is rejected for a multi-root or folderless window. Keep the
  directory outside the `.editchain` chain directory so archives survive a chain
  rebuild.

For example, to archive under `~/editchain-human-history`:

```json
{
  "editchain-history.tracking.enabled": true,
  "editchain-history.tracking.jsonl.enabled": true,
  "editchain-history.tracking.jsonl.directory": "~/editchain-human-history"
}
```

The archive writes one file per continuous VS Code activation and destination,
named `YYYY-MM-DD-session-0001.jsonl`. The date is the local calendar day when
the file was allocated and is kept across midnight; the counter is the largest
existing per-day counter plus one, zero-padded to at least four digits and
created exclusively. Reloading the window starts a new file; within one
activation each destination keeps its file, so pausing and resuming tracking,
disabling and re-enabling the archive, or switching to another destination and
back all reuse it. The archive retains all source events and embeds text instead
of chain blob references, so it can be re-imported without the chain; an
individual record may still reference an earlier change or
revision in the same archive. It retains code and unsaved buffer contents
locally, and the same capture limits apply: an 8 MiB default and maximum buffer,
with explicit gaps for skipped binary or oversized buffers. If the directory is
unwritable or the disk fills, the archiver logs the error and shows an error
notification, then stops archive writes while normal tracking continues. That
failed destination is retained for the rest of the activation, so re-enabling it
or switching back to it does not restart writes: fix the underlying problem and
reload the VS Code window to resume, which allocates a new file.
Re-import with `editchain import --provider human`; malformed JSON, an unsupported
schema, or an out-of-order sequence fails the import, and the importer reads only
the byte prefix it captured at discovery, so records appended after that wait for
the next import. The archive's recorded workspace is matched to the import's
`--workspace` (other workspaces are skipped) without relocation.

Editor-input and keyboard-correlated edits are human-work indicators under the
intentional-user assumption. The VS Code API does not authenticate physical
authorship. Other text changes remain observed changes. Focus gates attribution
and pauses exposure timers;
**no window-focus events or focus history are stored**. Visible code is an
opportunity to read, not proof of comprehension. Only the active visible editor
qualifies; folding gaps and navigation jumps are never filled in.

Opening the first text tab for a file records one open; closing its last tab
records one close. Split tabs share this file lifecycle. Tabs already open when
the recorder starts are retained as restored inventory without another open
activity. Opening starts a local read timer only when that editor is active and
visible; neither opening nor closing alone marks code as read. Old exposure
events remain supported for replay.

Version 0.1.1 shows **Editor opened** and **Editor closed** in the same human
graph series as reads and edits. Expand a human episode to see its individual
activities. Historical brief-exposure rows are hidden from Activity; qualifying
historical reads remain visible. Old source records and their identities are
retained.

Install the current VSIX and reload VS Code to activate an updated recorder.
The native service selected by `editchain-history.servicePath` must be rebuilt
from the same branch; updating only one component leaves an incompatible pair.

Version 0.1.5 ties keyboard fallback to one exact revision, editor, and resulting
cursor positions. Navigation or a later keystroke cannot claim an earlier
candidate after its selection update, save, or focus/activation boundary.
Saving records the revision without creating another edit. Coverage also reports
how many observed changes have no human attribution.

The recommended local build from `npm run install:local:editor-origins` uses VS Code's
proposed `textDocumentChangeReason` API when enabled. It captures Backspace,
Delete, Tab, and other editor input directly, and retains explicit origins for
programmatic, formatting, disk, and completion changes without counting them as
human-written code. The ordinary package stays on stable APIs and has partial
coverage: unspecified selection events cannot safely distinguish deletion from
automatic changes. Corrections that remove only text already typed in the active
human edit are retained as `typing_correction` indicators. Deletion of pre-existing
code still requires stronger input evidence.
The output channel reports the loaded extension version/path and the attribution
mode observed on the first change.

Version 0.1.8 keeps unconfirmed changes visible as **unattributed** file rows
with their exact diffs. They coalesce separately from human input, never count
as human edits, and never become additional AI-origin code in coverage reports.
Direct input reasons bypass the selection timer entirely. The stable fallback
waits at most 250 ms for a matching selection, then publishes an unattributed
edit instead of silently omitting it. The status bar explicitly identifies
limited attribution. The read-only `editchain-history.trackingStatus` command
returns the observed mode and capture counters without flushing pending work.

Version 0.1.9 gives coverage reports, Git-context observation, and edit recording
separate native connections. A slow coverage replay no longer queues typing or
saves behind it. Repeated report requests share one worker, which is released
when the report finishes or the extension stops. Slow capture deliveries log
queue time, request time, and the oldest event's age; renderer timings remain
separate. The status diagnostic includes the running VS Code client, extension
version, proposal declarations, and the input mode actually observed.

Version 0.1.4 retains the read receipt for an unchanged document revision and
viewport across interruptions, including replacement editor objects when a tab
returns. A qualified view has no recurring timer. Reloading VS Code still starts
a fresh recording, and a newly loaded document starts a new incarnation.

Version 0.1.3 removes the extra file disclosure from each human edit. The file
name and status appear directly on its connected graph row; one click opens
the retained diff. Episode folding still summarizes the full human episode.
The native service upgrades human edit rows from the 0.1.2 live cache without
rewriting recordings or resetting explicit episode disclosure choices.

Version 0.1.2 keeps one unsigned human identity GUID in the extension's local
profile storage. A reload starts a new capture session, while its reads, edits,
and tab lifecycle continue the same human branch for that workspace and chain.
Pauses and 30-second episode boundaries do not replace the identity. The GUID
requires no account or signature. Different profiles and worktrees stay
separate; historical sessions without a GUID retain their original attribution.
The stored file is `unsigned-human-identity.json` under the extension's global
storage directory. Tracking remains enabled by default; an explicit pause is
still respected.

Events remain local: a bounded outbox in VS Code workspace storage retries
`RecordEditorEvents` until the service acknowledges durable chain writes.
Version 0.1.10 retains full before/after snapshots for files up to 8 MiB, with
matching native replay, coverage-report, and transport limits. Unchanged text
reuses the previous snapshot's JSON encoding, while each event still carries
both complete snapshots. The outbox sends its saved UTF-8 bytes directly; a
snapshot event above the normal 4 MiB batch target travels alone. Each durable
batch can deliver while later snapshots are written. Journal writes submit the
full buffer and retry short writes. Reading the next pending journal overlaps
the current request; transport avoids decoding and re-encoding the saved JSON.
Freshly persisted source events are reused by native projection without another
disk read and JSON decode. Ordinary single-range validation compares complete
text regions without allocating whole-buffer UTF-16 copies. Historical replay
still verifies retained blobs.
Queued serialized data is capped at 256 MiB and pending disk data at 512 MiB.
Failures appear in the tracking status item and EditChain History output.
The outbox schedules persistence after **25 ms**, with a one-second recovery
poll and a **50 ms** retry for writer contention. Acknowledged human work wakes
History ahead of provider backlog processing. The native service retains an
incremental `editor-v1` checkpoint across recorder processes, avoiding repeated
full-history scans. A sudden host or machine failure can lose the not-yet-persisted
tail. Outbox overflow pauses
recording with a gap event. Raw snapshots include code contents and are retained
in the append-only chain, so storage grows with editing activity.

## Live Codex history

Open **EditChain: Open History Explorer** in a trusted workspace. Live updates
are enabled by default: the extension follows Git and imports growing Codex
rollouts while the panel is open. Codex capture requires the built
[codex-session-exporter](../../../codex/tools/codex-session-exporter/README.md).
**EditChain: Pause Live History** pauses observation for the current VS Code
session; **EditChain: Resume Live History** resumes it. Closing the panel stops
the collector, and opening it again restarts collection unless paused.
Set `editchain-history.live.enabled` to `false` to open static history by default.

- `live.sessionsPath` selects the sessions tree (default: `$CODEX_HOME/sessions`,
  or `~/.codex/sessions`). Use the same root as earlier imports so provider-relative
  cursor identities remain consistent.
- `live.codexHelperPath` selects `codex-session-exporter`, defaulting to the
  workspace helper release build, then PATH. It must support `--stream`.
  `live.cliPath` is retained for compatibility with the earlier prototype;
  the resident native service now owns live imports.
- Collection polls every 250 ms after the previous pass. It notices new,
  grown, replaced, or truncated rollouts. Recently modified sessions are
  processed first, in batches of at most 32 sources. Warm sources retain their
  byte cursor, hash and provider reducer. Large append bursts drain through
  bounded batches even without another file change.
- Import and publication are serialized. Complete source records and durable
  checkpoints remain the history authority; edits arriving during a pass trigger
  a later pass. Restarting reuses native checkpoints instead of duplicating nodes.
- Group toggles give immediate pending feedback and run ahead of queued background
  capture after the active transaction finishes. Repeated clicks keep their order
  while replacement rows are loading.
- Native conditional windows retain unchanged decoded content between revisions.
  The DOM mounts a 16-row margin per edge, independently of the 400-row data
  prefetch margin, and commits burst responses once per animation frame.
  `npm run perf:renderer` runs the frontend-only comparison harness.
- Revisioned block changes update persistent native indexes and bounded WASM caches,
  and DOM rows. Surviving selection, disclosure, focus and pixel scroll anchors
  remain attached to item identities. Staying at the top follows incoming
  history. New branch and merge connections grow from their attachment points,
  with continuous drawing across row boundaries. Existing SVG segments keep
  their animation clocks through later deltas. Lane spacing stays at 14.76px;
  dense graphs scroll horizontally, and incomplete prefetch cannot shrink the
  graph column. User disclosure uses a brief row transition with connections
  immediately visible. Reduced motion shows the final geometry
  immediately. Manual Refresh establishes a new baseline.
- Live Codex items fold along connected causal paths within their native task.
  Grouping adds no graph rows: task controls annotate existing activities;
  a collapsed summary replaces that physical path in the same anchor row.
  Singletons remain ordinary activities. The latest task opens by default when
  History first displays the head. Arrivals in the actual viewport open their
  task path with an expanded ribbon and animated physical rows. Automatically
  opened paths fold only after every member leaves the viewport; completion
  and moving just the ribbon offscreen do not fold them. Offscreen activity
  starts folded, and scrolling back alone does not reopen it. Prefetched rows
  do not count as viewed. Explicit opens and closes persist across scrolling,
  new records and restarts. The activity-count
  button toggles the task path. Single imported file edits and human edits show
  the file directly on the Change activity row, without an Import wrapper;
  agent file/output details retain their own chevron.
  Forks, merges, Git attachments and unresolved/error activity remain visible.
  Concurrent tasks retain chronological order without repeated header rows.
  Ordinary updates edit individual items and affected anchors, without resending
  a whole task. Search reveals the exact hidden item.

**Output → EditChain History** logs startup, per-delta source bytes, decoded
records, changed blocks and native timings. Automatic startup keeps the history
panel in focus; the Resume command also reveals the output channel.

This first milestone observes local Codex sessions and the first workspace
folder's Git HEAD/refs, including shared refs in linked worktrees. It also
notices external writes to chain segments. Git commits and imported file-edit
evidence appear automatically; arbitrary uncommitted filesystem writes are not
captured as edit evidence. Claude live collection and hook activity signals are
follow-up work.

Latency includes Codex's rollout flush, the next collection pass, incremental
projection, and rendering. Initial bootstrap can take substantially longer
than the polling interval. The status bar shows startup, queued imports, and
update progress; its tooltip also shows collection failures and retries.
Rollout `.jsonl.zst` archives are outside the importer's supported live input.

### Prepare a large history

Run from the repository root before opening a large workspace:

```sh
./target/release/editchain-legacy prepare-view --workspace /absolute/workspace \
  --chain /absolute/workspace/.editchain
```

This creates `CHAIN/live-v1`, including admission state, graph, task disclosure,
row pages and search. Later runs advance its saved frontier additively.
After upgrading task grouping or graph checkpoint semantics, run this command once
to migrate the existing checkpoint; it reuses saved rows and canonical indexes. Schema
3 restores exact subagent spawn/completion connections and causal ordering for tied
timestamps. The
extension opens the saved viewport first and starts collection after it renders.
Prepared native opening plus 500 rows took 0.24–0.40 seconds on the local
2.42-million-operation samples; these timings exclude VS Code startup.
Initial preparation remains expensive and uses disk space. A cold Codex helper
still rebuilds its source reducer.

## Dev Tunnels spike

Run **EditChain: Run Dev Tunnels Spike** from the Command Palette in the built
extension. VS Code's built-in GitHub provider supplies the session; the first
run may ask you to sign in or allow this extension to use the account with
`read:user` and `read:org`. No personal access token, tunnel CLI, or `repo` scope
is required by the implementation. Service acceptance of this account/token
flow is part of the live experiment.

The command creates one private tunnel with a generated ID and one logical TCP
port with the service's `auto` protocol setting. The service rejects the SDK's
`tcp` value; its supported settings are `auto`, `http`, and `https`
([port configuration](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/developer/dev-tunnels/cli-commands#advanced-manage-dev-tunnel-ports)).
The service's custom DNS `name` field is omitted because custom names are disabled;
a random label identifies the tunnel for recovery instead.
It connects a host and client through Microsoft's relay, requires end-to-end
encryption and a matching host key, exchanges 16 KiB of
synthetic data in each direction, then measures 20 echo round trips. Neither
endpoint opens a local TCP listener. No workspace files or history are sent.
The SDK can negotiate V1 (an encrypted SSH session directly between peers) or
V2 (a separate encrypted `SecureStream` for each forwarded connection)
([SDK client implementation](https://github.com/microsoft/dev-tunnels/blob/main/ts/src/connections/tunnelRelayTunnelClient.ts)).
For V1, the spike checks authentication, active encryption and message integrity
in both directions, and identical SSH exchange IDs at the two endpoints. For V2,
it requires the SDK's `SecureStream` transform on both ends. Unencrypted streams,
unverified host keys, and mixed relay protocol versions are refused.
Both endpoints run in the current Node.js extension host, including the remote
machine in a Remote SSH/container workspace. This first spike measures a
**same-account relay path**, without testing cross-account admission,
cross-network latency, durable replication, or reconnect behavior.

Open **Output → EditChain Dev Tunnels Spike** for the account label, stages,
negotiated relay protocol, payload counts, setup time, and RTT min/p50/p95/max.
A `PASS` is emitted only after the payload checks and tunnel deletion succeed. The network phase has
a 90-second deadline; cancellation still attempts cleanup with fresh deadlines.
The 20 samples are a smoke test, not a representative latency benchmark.

Recognized protocol-validation, custom-name, and service-disabled responses include
fixed diagnostic hints; raw SDK errors and response bodies remain hidden.
An HTTP 400 or 403 rejection clears its recovery record once a separate cleanup
check confirms there is no resource. Uncertain requests and failed cleanup
checks retain recovery records.

Only pending recovery markers and their account IDs are stored in extension
global state. Credentials and payloads are not stored or logged. After an
interrupted run, **EditChain: Clean Up Dev Tunnels Spike** retries deletion for
that account; starting another spike also performs recovery first. The tunnel
requests a one-hour inactivity expiry as a fallback for an abrupt process exit.
Cleanup also recognizes records from the earlier build that used custom names.

The connections/management/contracts packages are pinned to `1.3.56`, with
SSH/SSH-TCP `3.12.42`. Local tests exercise actual V1 SSH sessions and V2 SDK
encrypted streams, rejection of mismatched host keys and SSH sessions, HTTP
authorization construction with a stub service, VS Code authentication through
a stub provider, integrity failures, downgrade rejection, and cleanup. Run:

```sh
npm run compile
node --test test/harness/devTunnels*.test.js
```

The pinned SDK currently brings a moderate npm advisory through its `uuid` 3
dependency ([GHSA-w5hq-g745-h8pq](https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-w5hq-g745-h8pq)).
The advisory concerns buffered v3/v5/v6 calls; the inspected SDK uses v4. No
dependency override or audit suppression is applied in this spike.

## Runtime architecture

```text
VS Code extension.ts
  ├─ starts editchain-vscode-service over framed stdio
  ├─ opens one "EditChain History" webview
  ├─ forwards GetWindow, LocateRows, and FindInHistory from the webview
  ├─ opens OpenLivePaged and serializes capture, disclosure and delta publication
  └─ handles openJson/openDiff through service-validated identities

media/rust-history/loader.js
  └─ initializes the generated wasm-bindgen module

editchain-history-renderer (Rust/WASM)
  ├─ history state, request correlation, and virtual paging
  ├─ semantic row DOM and accessibility
  ├─ find-in-history navigation and expansion
  └─ per-row inline SVG graph fragments
```

There is no wgpu/WebGPU/WebGL renderer, shader, canvas overlay, hidden frame
mirror, alternate view, or side-by-side preview. `media/main.css` is the
only production stylesheet and `media/rust-history/loader.js` is the only
handwritten renderer script loaded by the panel.

## Service protocol

The native service supports these request bodies:

- `Open`
- `OpenLive`
- `OpenLivePaged`
- `ToggleLive { snapshot_id, key, task }` (`task: true` for the task path,
  `false` for the physical item's own details)
- `SyncLive { epoch, after_revision, codex }`
- `Refresh`
- `GetWindow { snapshot_id, offset, limit, include_layout }`
- `LocateRows { snapshot_id, keys }` (at most 2000 presentation anchors)
- `FindInHistory { snapshot_id, query, top_k }`
- `GetNodeDetails`
- `ResolveObject`
- `GetFileDiff`
- `RecordEditorEvents` (recorder host only)
- `GetEditorContext` (independent Git observation)
- `GetHumanWork` (coverage report)

The generic webview bridge permits only `GetWindow`, `LocateRows`, and `FindInHistory` and
requires an exact one-key request envelope. Details and file diffs are explicit
host actions, so arbitrary service requests cannot be tunneled through the
webview.

Paged live `GetWindow` returns visible coordinates and native geometry together.
Static history uses a two-pass first paint: rows are requested without graph
layout, then the same page is hydrated with lane geometry. Normal history uses
the fixed Activity projection; live mode uses current item blocks and retained
graph intervals. Both hide nested-repository rows.
`FindInHistory` uses Tantivy BM25 (persisted for live checkpoints) and resolves candidates
back to visible top-level row coordinates.

The `.editchain` segment log and blob store are authoritative. The render
snapshot under `.editchain/render/` and BM25 index are derived and rebuildable.

npm run ui:vscode:work
```

The harness verifies the exact minimal request envelopes, virtual paging,
two-pass layout, row semantics, accessibility, selection, disclosure,
find-in-history, JSON/diff identities, and the absence of a canvas renderer.

The renderer VS Code suite expects Git history and the imported Claude session
in `test/fixtures/claude`, as prepared by CI. Use a disposable checkout for that
fixture import, set `EDITCHAIN_RENDERER_E2E_WORKSPACE` to its path, and set
`EDITCHAIN_RENDERER_E2E_SERVICE` to the freshly built native service. The suite
loads this extension's current generated renderer assets. Its initial viewport
must contain both Git commits and an agent work group; an arbitrary working
chain may not contain the required rows there.

The live suite creates and removes a temporary Git repository and Codex rollout.
It opens the normal History command with default settings, then uses the real
exporter and native release binaries to verify automatic collection, multiple
edits within one unfinished turn, Git commit observation, and pause/resume replay.

For repository-wide Rust formatting, clippy, tests, docs, and dependency
policy, run `./scripts/lint.sh` from the repository root.

## Packaging

For direct input attribution in a local VSIX installation:

```sh
npm run install:local:editor-origins -- --runtime-args "$HOME/.vscode/argv.json"
```

Use the runtime-arguments file opened by **Preferences: Configure Runtime
Arguments** for your VS Code installation. The installer preserves comments,
existing settings and other opt-ins, backs up an existing file, and enables
`textDocumentChangeReason` only for `ambientlight.editchain-history`. It builds
and installs the matching service, renderer and extension. **Quit and reopen
VS Code** afterward: changing runtime arguments requires a full application
restart. The next edit must report `direct document change reasons` in Output.
This locally enabled API is still proposed; the ordinary Marketplace-compatible
package retains the stable fallback. [Microsoft's distribution guidance](https://code.visualstudio.com/api/advanced-topics/using-proposed-api).

To build and install the current checkout together with its native service:

```sh
npm run install:local
```

This rebuilds the service, renderer, and host, packages the version in
`package.json`, installs that exact VSIX, and verifies VS Code selected it.
Then run **Developer: Reload Window**. Check **Output → EditChain History** for
the loaded version/path. New recordings also retain `extension_version` in
`tracking_started`. A command ending in an older filename such as
`--install-extension ./editchain-history-0.1.0.vsix` reinstalls the old recorder,
even after successfully building a newer package.

To target a particular VS Code installation/profile, pass its CLI and options:

```sh
npm run install:local -- /path/to/code --user-data-dir /path/to/profile --extensions-dir /path/to/extensions
```

The service path printed by the installer must match
`editchain-history.servicePath` when that setting is explicitly configured.
For packaging without installation:

```sh
npm run build:renderer
npm run compile
npm run package
```

Run **Extensions: Install from VSIX…** in VS Code and select the generated
`.vsix` file. Configure `editchain-history.servicePath` to point to the native
service build; the service binary is built separately from the extension.

The generated `media/rust-history/pkg` artifacts are committed and CI verifies
that regeneration is deterministic.
