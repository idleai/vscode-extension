//! Reusable Claude, Codex and human history import adapters.
//!
//! This crate provides deterministic, idempotent import of Claude Code session
//! files, Codex rollouts and human archives into editchain operations. Every physical
//! JSONL line is preserved as a raw `ImportOp`; normalized operations
//! (messages, tools, commands, files) are derived alongside.
//!
//! Start with [`capture_import`] and [`ImportSource`]. Inspect the returned
//! [`batch::ImportBatch`], then persist it through a [`batch::DurableOpSink`].
//! [`native`] exposes reconciliation inputs without requiring a native runtime.
