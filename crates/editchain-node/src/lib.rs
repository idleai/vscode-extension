//! Legacy native application: viewer ingestion, history queries, and framed stdio.
//!
//! The standalone engine CLI lives in `crates/editchain`. This host backend
//! remains for its existing consumers until the roadmap's app/extension extraction.
//!
//! The two executables share the [`commands`] and [`history`] facades. [`Server`]
//! adapts protocol requests to that history backend. Persistence belongs to
//! `editchain_store`; reconciliation and transport remain internal modules.
