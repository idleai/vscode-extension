//! Import locally archived human editor history (`--provider human`).
//!
//! The VS Code recorder can retain one append-only JSONL archive per
//! activation. Every line is a frozen envelope carrying one complete
//! [`EditorEvent`]:
//!
//! ```text
//! {"format":"editchain-human-history","schema":1,"workspace_path":"/abs/ws","event":{...}}
//! ```
//!
//! Import replays those events through the same canonical admission path the
//! live recorder uses ([`crate::editor::record`]), so source identities,
//! attribution, before/after buffer contents, Git context, and lifecycle
//! observations are preserved, and re-importing an unchanged archive is an
//! exact, idempotent replay.
//!
//! Each archive's discovered byte prefix is first copied into a private,
//! read-only disk snapshot, and preflight and replay both read that snapshot —
//! never the original pathname. Rewriting, replacing, or deleting the original
//! between the two passes therefore cannot change which bytes are validated or
//! replayed, an archive that is still being appended to cannot inject
//! unvalidated tail records and cannot be followed indefinitely, and a prefix
//! that ends mid-record is rejected with a clear error instead of being parsed.
//! Preflight validates the prefix in line order — envelope format and schema,
//! per-event canonical validity, per-session sequence continuity, and stable
//! identity within a recorder incarnation — before any operation is written, so
//! a malformed, truncated, or incomplete prefix never produces a partial chain.
//! Preflight also freezes the workspace decision for every record, and replay
//! admits exactly the records preflight selected and validated, so retargeting a
//! recorded workspace symlink between the passes cannot promote a skipped record.
//!
//! Cross-record admission checks that need the chain itself (an identity that
//! conflicts with already-retained content, for example) still run during the
//! replay and fail loudly, leaving earlier batches durable and the failure
//! reproducible on retry.
//!
//! # Workspace and relocation assumptions
//!
//! `workspace_path` is the workspace the recorder observed, not the location of
//! this invocation. Records whose recorded workspace does not match
//! `--workspace` are counted and skipped, so one archive directory can hold
//! history for several workspaces. Matching canonicalizes both paths when they
//! exist and otherwise compares them lexically, so a workspace that was moved
//! to a different absolute path no longer matches: rebuild from the original
//! path, or record again from the new location. That decision is made once
//! during preflight and reused for replay, so retargeting a recorded symlink
//! after preflight cannot change which records are admitted. The destination
//! chain is selected solely by `--chain` (relative paths resolve against the
//! current directory, like the Claude and Codex providers).
