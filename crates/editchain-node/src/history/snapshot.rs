//! Versioned, immutable render snapshots for fast VS Code history startup.
//!
//! A snapshot stores the fixed default history view as newline-delimited
//! protocol rows plus compact random-access indices. It is derived data: the
//! segment log and blob store remain authoritative, and callers fall back to
//! the live projection whenever a snapshot is absent, stale, or incompatible.

/// Revision of projection/default-view semantics represented by this schema.
///
/// Bumped when the fixed default view's semantics change so stale snapshots
/// (which would otherwise silently serve the old default) live under a
/// different identity hash and are rebuilt from the live projection.
///
/// Revision 6: compacted import JSON now carries an explicit
/// `payload.echo_text_truncated` flag whenever a record's echo message text
/// was truncated by the display budget, so truncated texts never participate
/// in cross-record duplicate pairing; the projection also recovers
/// payload-level `exitCode` evidence from truncated previews and decodes
/// complete JSON string escapes recovered from a bounded prefix.
///
/// Revision 7: the fixed Activity view gains deterministic work-unit metadata
/// (`work_unit` markers), a conservative promotion flag, and execute-run
/// bundling (maximal runs of safe low-signal execute rows collapse into one
/// synthetic expandable node), so stale revision-6 snapshots must not serve
/// the old flat Activity view.
///
/// Revision 8 preserves canonical Codex custom-exec outcome headers through
/// bounded import compaction and keeps context-compaction checkpoints visible
/// but inline in the Activity path, so stale revision-7 snapshots must not
/// retain misleading success states or one-row compaction branches.
///
/// Revision 9 adds the bounded model-provider and agent-nickname subset from
/// Codex `session_meta` to history rows, so stale revision-8 snapshots must not
/// silently omit session provenance chips.
///
/// Revision 10 groups adjacent repeated Plan headings into typed expandable
/// Activity bundles while preserving every original reasoning record and the
/// linear graph path, so stale revision-9 snapshots must not serve duplicate
/// flat Plan rows.
///
/// Revision 11 projects exact provider occurrence/parent facts and contracts
/// metadata only along its unique graph-parent path. This prevents positional
/// metadata folding from manufacturing cycles and invalidates snapshots built
/// with the retired inferred relationship rules.
///
/// Revision 12 collapses provider occurrences only when their exact raw hashes
/// agree and resolves entity endpoints within the relation anchor's source.
/// Incremental payload revisions therefore remain distinct and ambiguous
/// cross-source entities never acquire an arbitrary representative.
///
/// Revision 13 classifies top-level Codex `token_usage_record` envelopes as
/// metadata and contracts legacy untagged records through their unique exact
/// parent path, preventing usage accounting from appearing as separate lanes.
///
/// Revision 22 keeps tool-result identity correlation out of visible ancestry,
/// preserves exact Claude response identities, contracts connected tool blocks
/// from one response, and makes derived-view parent rewrites authoritative over
/// immutable provider facts. This removes synthetic one-row tool branches
/// without changing canonical import evidence.
///
/// Revision 23 projects exact `ProducedBy` Git links in their causal direction:
/// the producing command remains on the agent chain and becomes an additional
/// parent of the immutable commit row.
///
/// Revision 24 omits every timestamp-zero row from the fixed presentation and
/// contracts undated structural relationship endpoints onto their nearest
/// dated rows.
///
/// Revision 25 restores timestamp-zero metadata as expandable sub-rows while
/// continuing to omit it from the top-level graph.
///
/// Revision 26 retains physical session continuity for provider occurrences
/// that carry identity but no resolved provider-parent relationship.
///
/// Revision 27 wraps linear activity intervals between chat turns in a
/// summarized outer work group and preserves existing bundles as a second
/// disclosure level. Expandable-row spans are now persisted alongside the
/// legacy top-level child counts.
///
/// Revision 28 refines session-summary presentation and graph endpoint labels.
///
/// Revision 29 contracts copied provider occurrences by canonical payload while
/// retaining only the surviving physical occurrence's incoming provider edge.
///
/// Revision 30 places disconnected graph components against exact per-lane
/// geometry, allowing operation lanes to be reused inside Git-only gaps.
///
/// Revision 31 adds semantic muted-chain state and child-owned muted graph
/// segment masks for cancelled request branches.
///
/// Revision 32 recognizes current Codex `spawnAgent` relations and suppresses
/// redundant inherited Git parents on their child branches.
///
/// Revision 33 preserves structural relation kinds when a metadata anchor is
/// bundled into its own target, so the first visible child keeps its subagent
/// tag.
///
/// Revision 34 marks the true newest row of every session independently of
/// turn work-unit boundaries and carries its whole-session entry count.
///
/// Revision 35 routes session-to-Git base references through shared,
/// interval-colored spines so many sessions based on one commit do not retain
/// one empty graph lane apiece until that commit row.
///
/// Revision 36 adds expandable source-control-style file rows with immutable
/// Git object identities and retained agent-edit identities.
///
/// Revision 37 flattens a work group's sole nested Execute/Plan group so its
/// original activities expand directly beneath the work row.
///
/// Revision 38 replaces provider-payload `WorkGroup` headlines with concise,
/// provider-neutral activity breakdowns.
///
/// Revision 39 retains compact token-accounting totals so expanded metadata
/// rows can show numeric usage and context-window subtitles.
///
/// Revision 40 keeps metadata out of parent summaries and adds concrete tool
/// invocation arguments to tool rows.
///
/// Revision 41 keeps bundled tool results child-only when the parent already
/// has concrete invocation detail.
///
/// Revision 42 preserves bounded command-output carriers and uses their stdout
/// or formatted output as the completed command row's Content subtitle.
///
/// Revision 44 coalesces exact same-session metadata descendants into their
/// retained session metadata root, keeps session-start records out of synthetic
/// work groups, and routes a lone session-to-Git anchor directly instead of
/// allocating an unnecessary shared-spine junction.
/// Revision 45 excludes every variant of a conflicted operation ID and uses
/// strict operation decoding. Snapshots built with first-version admission
/// must be rebuilt from the unchanged durable records.
///
/// Revision 46 qualifies Git graph and row keys by repository identity.
///
/// Revision 47 uses explicit repository roots and component-wise nesting.
/// Prefix-related sibling repositories remain visible as independent sources.
///
/// Revision 48 retains Git history gaps and observes refs once per history read.
/// Revision 50 uses typed derived edges without rewriting source parents.
/// Revision 51 uses one project-owned Activity tree and resolved graph for all
/// row coordinates, source ownership, and provisional or laid-out row metadata.
/// Revision 52 resolves Codex lifecycle endpoints from admitted provider
/// evidence across source captures, replacing covered legacy resolved notes.
/// Revision 54 also selects complete Claude content-block materializations.
/// Revision 53 uses immutable occurrence materializations and explicit logical
/// removals, retaining legacy records through the compatibility view.
/// Revision 55 bounds typed content previews and retains completeness.
/// Revision 56 keeps logical clocks and explicitly unknown source times out
/// of row timestamps and observed-time duplicate pairing.
/// Revision 57 folds exact Codex user-message echoes by logical incarnation
/// and complete source payload identity, including bounded display previews.
/// Revision 58 hides brief exposure and presents editor tab lifecycle.
/// Revision 59 puts a human edit's file directly on its physical graph row.
/// Revision 60 presents a single imported file edit as the Change activity.
